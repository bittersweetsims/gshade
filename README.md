October is a bit of a darker Halloween-ish shader, with desaturated colors and lower exposure. 
Soft Light is more of a cottagecore cozy shader, and my personal favorite day to day! It's the one I've shared screenshots of everywhere, and probably the one you're after. I figured I would share both though!
